# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
## General
- Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

## 0. Who am I?
What function would you use to print the type of an object?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ().

## 1. Where are you?
How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ().

## 2. Right count
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

## 3. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

## 4. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

## 5. Right count =+
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

## 6. Is equal
What do these 3 lines print?

## 7. Is the same
What do these 3 lines print?

## 8. Is really equal
What do these 3 lines print?

## 9. Is really the same
What do these 3 lines print?

## 10. And with a list, is it equal
What do these 3 lines print?

## 11. And with a list, is it the same
What do these 3 lines print?

## 12. And with a list, is it really equal
What do these 3 lines print?

## 13. And with a list, is it really the same
What do these 3 lines print?

## 14. List append
What does this script print?

## 15. List add
What does this script print?

## 16. Integer incrementation
What does this script print?

## 17. List incrementation
What does this script print?

## 18. List assignation
What does this script print?

## 19. Copy a list object
Write a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.
- The input list can contain any type of objects
- Your file should be maximum 3-line long (no documentation needed)
- You are not allowed to import any module

## 20. Tuple or not?
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

## 21. Tuple or not?
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

## 22. Tuple or not?
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

## 23. Tuple or not?
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

## 24. Richard Sim's special #0
What does this script print?

## 25. Richard Sim's special #1
What does this script print?

## 26. Richard Sim's special #2
What does this script print?

## 27. Richard Sim's special #3
Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? Answer with Yes or No.

## 28. Richard Sim's special #4
Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? Answer with Yes or No.

## 29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering.
Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

- introduction
- id and type
- mutable objects
- immutable objects
- why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
- how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects
## 30. Clear strings
Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration (For answers with numbers use integers, don’t spell out the word):

- How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
- How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (106-line2.txt)
- After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
- After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
- How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
